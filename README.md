# Hi, Iâ€™m Bruce Taylor ðŸ‘‹

I build websites and have been doing so for around two decades now. Quite a few of those years were spent in the travel industry as a senior / lead developer designing and developing ecommerce front-end solutions for Airmiles, Avios, and IAG Loyalty.

I mostly work on the "[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)" and find I'm best suited to roles that balance the user and developer experiences. I enjoy roles that both empower the team to write great code in whatever way feels right to them as well as ensuring that this does not negatively impact the user experience.

My core skills are semantic HTML, CSS, responsive design, progressively enhanced JS, PWAs, web performance, web accessibility, static site generation, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Astro](https://astro.build/) & [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). You'll also find me with my hands in the "*back-of-the-front-end*" and some DevOps stuff from time to time as well - (eg. JavaScript bundlers, build & deployment tooling, CI/CD etc.).

I try my best to build web solutions that are [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and as future-friendly as possible.

Here's a [bit more about me](https://brootaylor.com/about) if you're interested.
