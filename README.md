# Hi, I’m Bruce Taylor 👋

I build websites and have been doing so for just over two decades, and am currently contracted as a **Frontend Engineer** for [Admiral Group Plc](https://brootaylor.com/projects/admiral) on their customer facing websites.

I’m a front-end web developer, ui engineer/designer and generalist — *meaning I also do some visual design, back-end, and devops if needs be*.

I’m quite good at picking up new skills and programming languages, as well as problem solving. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with some really talented, kind and supportive people over the years, and much of the success I’ve enjoyed during my career is thanks to them.

All things impacting the user experience on the web matters to me. This is where I’m most comfortable and where I’ve ended up specialising. Which is why you’ll mostly find me tinkering around in the “[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)” — the somewhat broad and *fuzzy* intersection between design and back-end engineering.

I have experience creating frontend solutions to support design systems & design token architecture — (making sure components are consistent, scalable, and themeable) — and don’t tie developers to any one tech stack. It’s something I really enjoy working on and would like to do more of. I think a good design system should be a stable foundation. Flexible and tech-agnostic enough to stay relevant and useful, even as technologies come and go.

Oof, that was a mouthful eh!

In short... I try my best to build web solutions that are [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and as future-friendly as possible.
