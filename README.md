# Hi, I’m Bruce Taylor 👋

I build websites and have been doing so for just over two decades, and I’m currently contracted as a Frontend Engineer for [Admiral Group Plc](https://brootaylor.com/projects/admiral), working on their customer facing websites.

I’m a front-end web developer, UI engineer/designer, and generalist &mdash; *meaning I also do some visual design, back-end, and DevOps work when needed*.

I’m fairly quick at picking up new skills and programming languages, and I enjoy problem solving. I’ve been fortunate to work with some really talented, kind, and supportive people over the years, and much of the success I’ve enjoyed in my career is thanks to them.

Anything that impacts the user experience on the web matters to me. This is where I’m most comfortable and where I’ve naturally ended up specialising. As a result, you’ll mostly find me tinkering around in the “[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)” &mdash; the somewhat broad and slightly *fuzzy* intersection between design and back-end engineering.

I have experience creating frontend solutions that support design systems and design token architecture, ensuring components are consistent, scalable, and themeable &mdash; without tying developers to any single tech stack. It’s work I really enjoy and would like to do more of. To me, a good design system should be a stable foundation: flexible and tech-agnostic enough to remain useful as technologies come and go.

Oof, that was a mouthful, eh!

In short, I try my best to build web solutions that are [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and as future-friendly as possible.
