# Hi, I‚Äôm Bruce Taylor üëã

I build websites and have been doing so for around two decades. Many of those years were spent in the travel industry as a senior / lead developer designing and developing ecommerce front-end solutions for Airmiles, Avios, and IAG Loyalty.

I mostly work on the ‚Äú[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)‚Äù. The somewhat *fuzzy* intersection between design and back-end engineering. I find I‚Äôm well suited to and enjoy roles that balance the user & developer experiences and empower the team to write great code in whatever way feels right to them, while ensuring that the user experience is not negatively impacted.

I‚Äôm pretty good at picking up new skills and programming languages, as well as problem solving. My core technical skills include HTML, CSS, responsive design, progressively enhanced JS, PWAs, web performance, web accessibility, static site generation, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) & [Astro](https://astro.build/). From time to time, you‚Äôll also find me with my hands in the ‚Äúback-of-the-front-end‚Äù utilising Node.js, configuring an API or fiddling with JavaScript bundlers, build & deployment tooling, and CI/CD workflows.

I try my best to build web solutions that are [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and as future-friendly as possible.

Here's a [bit more about me](https://brootaylor.com/about) if you're interested.
