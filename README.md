# Hi, I’m Bruce Taylor 👋

I build websites and have been doing so for just over two decades.

I mostly work on the “[front-of-the-front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/)”, the somewhat broad and *fuzzy* intersection between design and back-end engineering. I find I’m well suited to and enjoy roles that balance the user & developer experiences and empower the team to write great code in whatever way feels right to them, while ensuring that the user experience is not negatively impacted.

I’m fairly good at picking up new skills and programming languages, as well as problem solving. My core technical skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive & device-agnostic web design, themeable design system configuration, Progressive Web Apps *(PWAs)*, web performance, web accessibility, static site generation, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), and WordPress. From time to time, you’ll also find me with my hands in the “back-of-the-front-end” utilising Node.js, PHP, configuring an API or fiddling with JavaScript bundlers, build & deployment tooling, and CI/CD workflows.

Oof, that was a mouthful eh!

In short... I try my best to build web solutions that are [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), [usable](https://trentwalton.com/2014/03/10/device-agnostic/) and as future-friendly as possible.
